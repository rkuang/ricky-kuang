title: Just do it.
---

I often hesitate before making big decisions. I think the main thing that holds
me back is fear. Fear of what, exactly? I haven't been able to put a finger on
that. Maybe it's fear of the unknown. Maybe it's fear of failure. Maybe the fear
is of something subconscious that I haven't been able to put to words yet.
Whatever the case may be, I can't let silly emotions keep me from moving forward
and getting better each and every day.

Just do it. Just do it, see how far you'll get, and deal with your circumstances
when the time comes.
