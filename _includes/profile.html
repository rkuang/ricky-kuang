      Hi, I'm Ricky Kuang, a software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work as a <strong>Software Developer</strong> at
      <a href="https://www.novacoast.com/">Novacoast, Inc.</a>, an IT Professional
      Services and Product Development company. At Novacoast, I am the lead
      developer on our internal automation projects, a versatile technical
      consultant in the field, and August 2020 Developer of the Month!
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll find me practicing calisthenics,
      trying new recipes in the kitchen, or drawing in my sketch pad.
