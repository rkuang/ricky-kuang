short_description: An iOS application that allows users to quickly calculate an appropriate tip for their table service

I created Tip Pro in the Spring of 2018. Tip Pro is an iOS application you can
use to easily calculate a tip for your table service and split a bill amongst
your friends.

While working on Tip Pro, I learned to create custom views to extend Apple's
UIKit. I implemented the custom views using IBDesignables and IBInspectables,
enabling me to configure these views directly in XCode's Interface Builder. I
also learned to use UserDefaults to persist user preferences.
