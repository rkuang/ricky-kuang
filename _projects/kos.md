short_description: An operating system that runs on a simulated MIPS machine and mimics the capabilities of Linux

During my Winter 2018 quarter at UC Santa Barbara, I took an Operating Systems 
class focused on the design and implementation issues associated with OSes.
KOS is the final project for that class and is a culmination of the knowledge
I acquired.

KOS is an operating system for a simluated MIPS machine. Everything had to be
implemented from scratch: the boot-up process, memory management, exception
handling, device interrupt handling, system calls, process execution, and much
more!
