Chronooz is a Ruby on Rails web application 
[Josue Montenegro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josuemi) and I worked on at 
UCSB's 2016 Hackathon event. The idea behind Chronooz is that we often found
ourselves reading a news article and wondering: what were the events leading up
to this? So we decided to make an app that retrieves that context for us!

Chronooz displays a timeline of related events for the most popular news
stories. We utilized APIs from various news sources to extract resources from
articles and establish story connections. Although this is by no means a state
of the art example of connecting stories via machine learning and natural
language processing, we thought it was a cool way to showcase our ability to
build a nifty little Ruby on Rails app in a short period of time.
