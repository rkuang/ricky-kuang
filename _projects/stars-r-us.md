When I was enrolled in CMPSC 174A at UC Santa Barbara, I learned about the
fundamentals of database systems. For the final project, I paired up with my
friend [Alan Tran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanthetran/), and we were tasked
with building a relational database management system called Star's R Us.

Star's R Us is a Java application that connects to a MySQL database using JDBC.
It's a platform where users can trade imaginary stocks at an imaginary 
brokerage. Unlike in reality, the stocks at Star's R Us and their values
represent movie stars and their popularities.

Alan and I worked together to design and implement everything from
the database schema, the user interface, and the backend code that handled
transactions such as managing account funds, trading stock, and retrieving stock
information.
