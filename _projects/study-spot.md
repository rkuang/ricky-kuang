Study Spot is a Yelp-like iOS application where users can share their favorite 
places to study. They can create new locations, add tags, and write reviews.

I made Study Spot to learn how to use CocoaPods to streamline development. I 
used Google Firebase as my datastore to learn about NoSQL databases. Looking 
back, I can certainly see how a relational database would have been better for
this application, but I'll treat it as a learning experience ðŸ˜‰.
